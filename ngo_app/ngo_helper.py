Students who used to drop out of the schools because of unsatisfactory teaching methods or lack of finances to afford a tutor are regularly attending school these days owing to the remedial classes conducted by CSSAR. The education programme fills the gaps in school education and sustains the interest of children and their parents in a formal education system. The teachers pay individual attention to the students to have a better understanding of the subject. This has helped in enhancing their performance in their schools and motivated them to pursue higher studies.Spoken English classes are also conducted for secondary level school students to enhance their communication skills and make them better equipped for the future. Remedial classes to the school going slum girl children are conducted separately to reach out to the girls in the slums who are generally side-lined or neglected in the education system due to various constraints. So far, CSSAR has educated 3104 children. About 500 children attend the remedial classes every year.',

As she thought through the solution, she believed that the answer lay in a people\'s movement that needed to come together to provide every child in India an excellent education. In 2007, Shaheen met with Wendy Kopp, the Founder of Teach For America and was struck by the idea of leadership being at the core of the solution. In 2009, Teach For India welcomed our first cohort, the Class of 2009, to the Fellowship. The 87 "niners" formed the beginning of what Shaheen hoped would become a nationwide movement of diverse leaders. In 2011, their Niners graduated from the Fellowship and became the first cohort in their Alumni movement. Through their work as Alumni, the hope was that they would become lifelong leaders for equity. Their first cohort of Alumni went into teaching, teacher training, school leadership, and government policy. Today, they have 1145 Fellows working relentlessly in the short-term to change the lives of 40,075 students in their classrooms and become leaders for change themselves. And they have 2581 Alumni who are collectively fuelling the larger movement towards our vision. The problem of educational inequity cannot be solved alone.

The mission of the organisation is to have sustainable holistic development among the underserved.During 1986-87 the founder of the organization was a student in the Bharathiar University doing studies on Ethnic Tribes and their traditional practices. The needs of the underserved community and desire to support them as a part of the society was his reason for joining the voluntary sector.Mr. A. S. Sankaranayaranan, Director of NMCT, formerly a Professor at an Ayurvedic college, met tribal people during his research in the forest area. He found that the Tribes were selling their lands for meager amounts and so he decided to dissuade them by making them economically viable. NMCT also felt the necessity for empowering women and run programmes on childcare, health and hygiene for the needy.In 2017, Native Medicare Charitable Trust was awarded the Credibility Assurance Team by the Credibility Assurance Team Certificate of Appreciation for Awesomeness and the Guide Star India by the Guide Star India Commitment to Transparency.',

                  'description': "In 1992, an organization called Prerana had been working with farmers in North Karnataka's Raichur district. Prerana offered its office as a shelter for children, who were mostly living on Raichur railway station.Over the next 3 to 4 years, the activities with the children expanded and recreational activities were included such as picnics, skill training programs like cycle-repair, screen printing and so on. Although the attempts to place them in jobs met limited success, the engagement with children continued. After a family adopted one child, they realized that many of these children were not abandoned by their families, but had opted to 'flee' because of certain reasons (which in most cases were not very serious) without actually thinking of the consequences.The concept of 'restoration' or 'home-placement' of children thus began to take shape. Ground research revealed that the parents are also distraught when the child leaves; and they often attempt to search the child without any leads. There was a zeal within the team members to work on this issue in a dedicated manner and a new organization was carved out of Prerana. SATHI was born.Founded in 1992, SATHI was formally registered in 1997 in Raichur, Karnataka. With the growth of the organization and expansion of work, SATHI moved its head office to Bangalore. Over the years, SATHI has worked in more than 40 different locations in 14 states across India and has helped nearly 60,000 children reunite with their families.Passionate about children and their well-being, Pramod Kulkarni founded SATHI with an initial focus on providing immediate care and opportunities of resettlement for run-away children. Experience and research convinced him that run-away children could be settled back with families. An action-oriented individual, he decided to demonstrate this possibility - in large numbers and at a national scale.SATHI continued to work with Raichur as a base until the year 2000. During this phase, the work was restricted to Raichur and Wadi in Karnataka and Guntakal in Andhra Pradesh. From 2000 to 2006, the work expanded to cover other locations in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The year 2000 also marked the beginning of SATHI's work in Government Children Homes.The year 2006 marked a new phase in SATHI's history, when it began to expand its geographical spread across the country through collaborations with other NGOs. Between 2006 and 2010, SATHI collaborated with more than 30 different organizations and covered railway stations in 10 states including Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh.",

Though NASEOH started off with the initial purpose of creating awareness about issues concerning the differently-abled in the areas of Education, Vocational Training, and Employment, they later decided to provide direct services through capacity building for effective integration. They do this through various projects in the areas of Education, Vocational Training, Employment, Rehabilitation, and Disability prevention. Apart from this, NASEOH also assists the differently abled by identifying and providing them with suitable mobility aids like wheelchairs, calipers, tricycles, crutches, and splints.

It offers primary healthcare to the underprivileged community through a chain of 15 primary health centres located in remote rural regions of West Bengal and the urban slums of Kolkata. Against a nominal amount of Rs. 60 ($0.89) a patient receives consultation, treatment and free medicines for a week. A project started by two brothers, has now transformed to an initiative serving millions of patients per year and generating employment for many. The organization was set up following the prolonged suffering of one of its founders with cancer, since an early age. This exposed to him and his brother, the lack of quality health care facilities in India, particularly so for the rural poor. The brothers got together with like-minded people and established RHCF which provides low cost, quality health care in rural areas based on a model that is scalable, sustainable and replicable. Anant and Arun Nevatia wound up their booming construction business and started this initiative for the poor. He realised there is no end to money making and he decided to give back to society. Taking this vision forward the brothers started this initiative to provide health care to the poor. RHCF centres run six days a week throughout the year. They have treated over 15 lakh patients in their 15 primary health care centres.',

To address this problem, BREAD has set up 1024 Children's Libraries in government schools during the last 9 years in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to inculcate a habit of reading books among them.

The programs are spread across different slum areas in the city. Two of their major interventions are in the field of education as well as elderly. Under education, Sarthak Prayas runs remedial education centers where students from government schools attend classes every day to improve their knowledge. The centres help students complete their homework and revise lessons of the day. They also impart life skills and teach them how to deal with real life situations. The organisation runs eight centers in Delhi/NCR with 40 students studying in each center. Since the children are from an impoverished background, the organisation also supplements their nutrition with packed food every day after the class. In addition to this, as part of recreation for the children, the centres also celebrate children's birthdays every month. During the celebrations, children cut cake and the teachers distribute gifts. Each day the students attend sessions for approximately 90 minutes. Their other program focuses on people at the other end of the age spectrum, the underprivileged elderly. The premise behind this is that the elderly have struggled all their life for food, shelter and livelihood. They have now reached an age where their bodies don't allow them to work a lot and their economic conditions do not allow their families to be able to take care of them either.Sarthak Prayas visits the slums and identifies elderly people who were unable to take care of themselves. As a part of their intervention, they provide dry ration on a monthly basis for a one person's need. They also provide quarterly clothing and toiletries. The material is distributed in designated locations near their slums every month. Apart from the above two programs, they also run a telephonic helpline centre for people who require blood transfusions. Sarthak Prayas tries to fulfil requests raised within 2 hours. Finally, they also organise awareness camps at public places and schools on the dangers of Global warming. Till now, they run such camps for more 1000 students in the Delhi/ NCR region.",

Maria Seva Sangha was established in 1981 to undertake educational, medical, housing and other social activities in aid of the poor and the underprivileged of all ages, irrespective of caste, creed, and community.The initial seeds of Maria Seva Sangha was planted by Ms. Ethel Brito, a prominent social worker. Back in the 1970s, Ms. Brito was strongly concerned by the poor quality of life of the weaker sections of society in Bangalore. Her dream of improving the plight of the underprivileged began to grow and in 1981, the Maria Seva Sangha was born, to cater to their needs.Some of the issues that Ms. Brito felt strongly about inlcuded:Poor, deserving students not being able to pursue higher studies due to financial constraints.Hundreds of poverty stricken children attending school on empty stomachs.Shortage of housing for battered women, widows and low income group families.Large numbers of elderly people desperately wanting care and shelter.In 1981, Ms. Brito, along with a group of like-minded, public-spirited people, set up a voluntary organization and they called it, Maria Seva Sangha. They worked together to obtain registration, tax-exemption, FCRA sanction and the like, to establish the institution's credentials in the eyes of the public. Several projects were launched to support economically deprived children, widows, families and elders, through a strong financial base slowly built up by the generosity and goodwill of donors.However, following prolonged litigation, spanning over one-and-a-half decades, related to the eviction of tenants and settlement of claims on properties bequeathed to MSS, the Sangha's resources were severely depleted. With good support from donors and the public, on closure of these issues, the Sangha has been able to embark whole-heartedly on two new projects, the Senior Citizens Home and the development of apartment buildings and residential sites for the underprivileged- Mathrudhan- at Krishnarajapuram .The Midday Meal Scheme for underpriviledged children commenced in 1987. It aims to improve attendance in schools along with the health of the children and their performance in studies. The incentive of free midday meals pulled children from slum areas into schools thus avoiding them getting involved in theft, drugs prostitution, etc.They currently aid 21 schools in Bangalore Urban and Bangalore Rural.  The monitoring of meals effectiveness is done by Maria Seva Sangha aided by St.Anne's Women's Degree College, Ulsoor.Over the past 37 years, the dream of one lady has become a reality, benefiting thousands of poor and needy persons and has given the members of the MSS great personal satisfaction for their selfless service.",

The Institute was started by Mr. Pranjal Dubey, who left his high profile job in SAP Labs, Bangalore to set up this institute in his native village. Pranjal Dubey comes from a family that traditionally provided the head priest for the Sant Singaji Temple at Sandalpur in Madhya Pradesh. At his father's passing in 1996 it was his duty to take over this role, and although he returned to Sandalpur annually for the temple festival, he continued his career as a software engineer in Bengaluru with the blessing of the village elders. Every time he visited he encountered desperation from parents and youth who struggled to rise above poverty, despite the education and qualifications accessible to them. On investigation, he found the education available to local youth to be substandard. It became clear that he had a mission to change this and the chain of poverty that was left behind. In only 7 years, the organization has achieved stellar results . 15 students, 14 of them being girls have obtained University ranks, putting Sandalpur on the education map of Madhya Pradesh.

At that time children of socially victim women, children of convicts received no support from government or any agency. Mr.Banerjee felt that every child needs shelter, care and protection and opportunity to grow. Thus SAMPARC - Social Action for Manpower Creation was born as an organization in 1990. The journey of SAMPARC began with only 7 orphans and today over 500 children - orphan, children of socially victim women, destitute, and needy and also children of convicts, all of them are living under one shelter known as Balgram of SAMPARC organization. They do not have the social stigma of whatever background they came from. They grow freely like other common children. They grow with all cultural and social values. At the same time, they learn various social and cultural values and traditions and are exposed to community life. The organization has served around 500 children. In 2016, Amit Banerjee was awarded the Samajik Puraskar Award by the Parampujya Swami Ramdevji Maharaj Yog Diksha & Rashtranirman Sabha for special contribution towards the care and protection and holistic development of orphan and destitute children.',

This phenomenon is common to all Dalit women. This kind of injustice unveiled by the society on the women folk hurt her feelings from childhood. This inner urge and burning desire motivated her to start an organisation for the cause of women, especially Dalit.The founder's father was a school head master and she always had an inclination towards social service looking at the condition of the people living in remote areas of her village, especially women. Thereafter, she decided to start SHGs and also had offers to join the govt. but decided not to do so as that would mean having to succumb to political pressure. Slowly, the activities gained momentum and she increased the focus areas. She has received a lot of support from her husband. The organization is run by women and works for women beneficiaries from the dalit community (especially scavengers) irrespective of religion.Mrs. Nancy has 16 years of experience in organizing the unorganized labours like bullock cart workers, farmers, domestic workers, scavengers and rural artisans and development works. She has organized 680 women self help groups. She is a master trainer in Entrepreneur development training and self help group members and leaders.Vizhuthukal Trust primarily works for landless labourers, agricultural coolies and scavengers in Tirunelveli. Due to modernization and urbanization, agricultural activity has come down narrowly over the years. So women in the village find it very difficult to find any kind of work. The condition of destitute, abandoned and widowed women gets further worsened against this background. Vizhuthukal Trust runs various development programs for the welfare of the rural community under Tirunelveli Corporation. One of these is their educational program, through which they support play centres. In a survey that the Trust conducted amongst these children, they learnt that many children had expressed that their wish is to celebrate their birthdays with their friends and family. So the organisation has a program for celebrating birthdays of children.The organization's primary focus is to work for the betterment of children, women and the aged (primarily women). They do this through: 1) Organization of women working as house maids2) Self-Help Group formation for women3) education Support for poor children in slums/orphans4) Support for destitute women who are aged5) Children's birthday celebration programme6) Income Generation Programme",

                  'description': "City life seem alluring to many, especially the young. It is estimated that in Hyderabad and Secunderabad alone there are about 60000 street or working children. On an average, 70-80 children stray into the cities daily. They live on streets, railway platforms, bus stations and in unhygienic, disease-infested slums. Don Bosco Navajeevan (DBNJ) has street educators located in hot spots to offer continuous support to children on the street through a unique approach called Street Presence. They are 'present' round-the-clock at various strategic locations where children enter the city, live or work. They work closely with the Police, APSRTC and Railway Staff. Child Rescue Booths set up by them help rescue children who run away from home and protect them from any form of abuse. The strategy that evolved from Navajeevan's experience at Vijayawada is to first speak to the children and gain their confidence and trust. A Street Presence Team, constituted of six street educators, is set up.  The team contacts street children and builds a good rapport with them. During the past 11 years, they have contacted more than 28000 children in and around Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Kachiguda Railway Stations that have got the highest level of concentration of street children. The team has placed more than 9500 children back at their homes after due counselling. They also arranged better job placements for more than 440 boys.",

The idea was suggested to her by one of Vathsalya's trustees as Vathasalya struggled to place differently abled kids in homes. Kutumba was started as a home for boys with MR/CP. Patients were mainly referred by Spastic Society. Until 1997-98 the boys were sent to Spastic Society for vocational training. However slowly Kutumba started accepting girls but as there was an issue housing boys and girls, they started weaning of the boys. Once the last boy had left they tied up with APD to offer safe housing for the girls attending APD vocational training courses.Kutumba was operating out of rented premises until 2006 they moved into their own premises. The 10000 sq.ft of land was donated by Mary's cousin and two corporate donors. I-flex solutions, Bangalore and Stichting Geron in the Netherlands came forward and donated 15 lacs each to fund the building of two cottages. In 2007 Goldman Sachs sponsored roofing between the 2 cottages to create a sheltered space for activities. This is when Kutumba started a preschool/daycare for kids of daily wage workers (mainly construction workers). Kutumba has a residential facility for differently abled young women. The ages of these young women range between 19 and 30. Most of the girls are orthopedically challenged. A few are with speech and hearing impairment. These girls are from rural parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh from very poor homes. All the girls attend 1-year or 2-year vocational & technical training classes at The Association of People with Disability (APD). The beneficiaries are provided food, shelter, transport free of cost. The girls stay at Kutumba for one to three years on an average. An average of 20 girls stay, although the numbers could go up to 30 or come down to 15 depending on the period of training and admission of new residents. APD also sends short-term course trainees. These girls stay here anywhere between 2 days to 3 months. Kutumba also runs a pre-school and day care (10:30 a.m. -4:00 p.m.) for young children between the ages of 2-5 years. These kids come from a nearby slum area. Most of their parents are daily wage workers or are employed as maids. During the hours that they spend at Kutumba, these children learn rhymes, numbers and play games. The teacher engages them in activities for a couple of hours in the morning. After lunch, they have rest. Parents are not charged any fees.",

They created Professional Assistance for Development Action (Pradan), to systematically groom and enable professionals with empathy towards the poor to work at the grassroots level.In 1987 PRADAN began working with the government and over the years they have played a major role in developing such programs as IRDP, SGSY, and the National Rural Livelihood Mission.

These visits teach the parents about how to care for their disabled child.

The half-way-home is a temporary place, where the patients stay at for a small period. Screening of potential residents is carried out by a series of interviews with the candidate at the mental hospital.

On being selected, the patients are asked to come to Paripurnata for a couple of hours for a planned stay on a fixed date to see for themselves the environment of Paripurnata and meet the house staff, administrative staff and present residents. A sub-committee for monitoring the psychosocial rehabilitation process takes the final decision. Paripurnata's rehabilitation programme offers pharmacotherapy, occupational therapy, non-formal education, and counseling. Women also re-learn cooking, cleaning, shopping and other skills needed for daily living. They are regularly taken out for picnics, tours, and other social gatherings for developing social skills. The duration of the planned stay is usually for 2-3 years. As the patients get rehabilitated, they are reunited with their families under the guidance of a professional counselor. Regular follow-ups oversee the re-entry after they return to their homes. Follow-up program entitles regular home visits, family counseling and family meets. In case of relapse, they are re-admitted to the Home for short periods. The duration of the follow-up programme is for three years. The duration of time for which the patients stay at the half-way Home sometimes even go up to 9-12 years.

It seeks to dissolve the barriers that rob children of the opportunity to realize their rights. In the 1980s, the making of Mira Nair\'s \'Salaam Bombay\' (award winning film) revealed the dark underbelly of Mumbai\'s streets, where several childhoods were at stake. A combination of socio-economic exigencies, political circumstances and parent\'s struggle for survival created a large population of children, living and working on the streets of India. As all across the country street children, an invisible section of the society, continued an invisible struggle on the streets of Delhi too. In the day time, children grapple with the challenges of street life.When night falls, they curl up in crevices - at the end of the platform, under a staircase, in the subway - where the possibility of security exists. Ms Praveen Nair, Chairperson and Trustee at Salaam Baalak Trust testifies: It took us quite a while to break the ice with the boys. Sanjoy (Roy) and myself would scout the railway platforms every day, chat with the boys...however they had been cheated time and again, and we weren\'t the first to propose help. So they would laugh off our intentions but we never gave up.Finally when we answered their urgent call for help to care for a terribly sick boy, a friend of theirs, began the never-ending bond." Spending quality time with these children, the founding members of the Trust realised that while most of these children were forced into these circumstances, many of them had chosen this life; what set them apart, was their chutzpah, their spirit. Ms Nair adds: "We started with the idea of donating blankets to the children in the bitter winter cold. We started at the very place where GRP centre now stands. However, we proved naAve about their actual needs. The children told us that sleeping under a blanket invited sexual attentions from older children. They stuffed newspapers and wore layers of clothing (all the clothes they possessed, actually) this not only kept them warm but also kept the clothes from being stolen! That\'s when we realised children needed a roof over their heads and safe spaces."From three staff and 25 children on a balcony of the Ground Reserve Police at the New Delhi Railway station more than 29 years ago, we have now grown to over 200 staff, providing support services for over 9,000 children a year in Delhi & the NCR region through our 22 centers. Over the years, Salaam Baalak Trust has successfully worked with over 81,000 children; significant numbers have been restored to their families.They have 2 children who have completed their engineering and one boy who is currently pursuing engineering, 3 who have completed their Masters in Arts programme, 9 who have won scholarships for advanced programmes to American Universities, 43 children in various graduation programmes sponsored by an Australian University, and many more who are pursuing their academic career in schools and colleges across India.',

The gap between education and employment was a big one to bridge - and without employment education seemed meaningless and added to the frustration of youth from these disadvantaged communities. Youth tended to drop out and meander aimlessly at the vulnerable 16 - 18 year age group. Thus was born an intervention that looked at specific career outcomes that gave purpose and direction to their lives. Antarang started with a pilot group of 20 youth from slums across Mumbai in a 6 weekend intervention. The success of that pilot and the resultant placement of >50% of youth from that group slowly led to more groups and more partnerships.Priya Agrawal has held key leadership roles in the social sector, having headed organisations like The Akanksha Foundation and SNEHA in the past.Antarang Foundation is a registered not-for-profit organisation that works with disadvantaged young adults. Through structured interventions, they motivate young people to stay in education until they are 18, after which, we train them in employability skills and place them in careers of their choice. They do this through two career focused programmes CareerAware and CareeReady.Their CareeReady programme is a career readiness and employability skills training programme for youth in the age group of 18 - 25 years. Students undergo a well-defined regiment of development and training. The program consists of 5 key aspects spread over different sessions: Career awareness, Self-awareness, Work skills, Work ethics and Business spoken English.CareeReady groups in the communities are a mix of adolescents with different educational backgrounds - some may be school dropouts, others may be pursuing their 12th or beyond. Different techniques are used to keep the batch engaged given the inconsistent educational backgrounds. Several batches of CareerReady Programme are run simultaneously across multiple locations in Mumbai. Keeping this diversity in mind, facilitators or trainers use a \'Buddy System\' which enhances learning as well as boosts confidence.Rather than a one-way dialogue, all concepts are explained with the help of role plays and various activities. Students are also encouraged to work on projects in groups. They support interactive style of learning rather than a lecture/authority style of delivery. They believe in the concept of \'Do and Learn\' and therefore, promote self-learning to develop critical thinking skills and retain knowledge that leads to self-actualisation. Trainers also use audio-visual aids as and when required to introduce an element of fun!The CareerAware program"What do you want to be when you grow up?" is at once an exciting and terrifying question for any teenager or young adult. At this stage, it is the awareness of options, the ability to make an informed choice and the process of charting out a career path that motivates adolescents and young adults to stick to education, and set career goals. In India, the Right to education ends at the age of 14, and only 1 in 2 children complete high school. The ratio of students in higher education is sadly even lower. Every school drop-out is prone to high risk behaviour, and usually end up in informal employment, characterised by low wages and no benefits.To break this cycle, Antarang introduced the CareerAware program. The program targets students who fall in the crucial 14 - 17 years age bracket. Through intensive self awareness, career awareness and career planning sessions, CareerAware encourages teenagers to stay in education until they are 18 years old. By emphasising on the number and quality of options that become available only if they stay in education, CareerAware reinforces the importance of education in young minds.',

Other interventions are in the area of environment for the farming communities in the region. Under this, they build watersheds for farmers to allow them to have contiguous supply of water for all their farming needs.

So far SSM has built watersheds in a total of 12751 hectares cumulatively. SSM has built a comprehensive program which is spread across the different stakeholders of the community from education for children to livelihoods for men and women and conservation of environment.",

It was set up by Dr. Vibha Krishnamurthy, Founder and Executive Director, who trained at Children\'s Hospital, Boston as a Developmental Pediatrician.  After returning to India, the lack of facilities for children with developmental needs led her to set up UMMEED CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTER.  From an initial team size of 3, UMMEED today is an 80+ member strong professional team.UMMEED\'s vision is to help children with developmental disabilities and those at risk for acquiring disabilities reach their maximum potential and be integrated in society. There are over 50 million children in India with developmental disabilities and over 650,000 in Mumbai alone. Out of these, not even a quarter have access to quality care. UMMEED addresses this mammoth issue through 4 verticals:*        Each year there are over 1,110 children and families supported at their clinic. *        UMMEED assesses and provides therapies for children with a wide range of developmental disabilities such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cerebral Palsy, Intellectual Disability, Learning Disability, Genetic Syndromes such as Down Syndrome, William Syndrome, Fragile X Syndrome, Hearing Impairment. *        Over 60% of the children availing services at UMMEED\'s clinic are from low/mid socio-economic backgrounds. *        Ummeed also runs an Early Intervention Center (EIC), which is a mother-child program modeled on the pre-school model, where children between the ages of 2-6 years are trained on communication skills, play skills, social interaction, etc. with the objective of getting them school ready. Ummeed is one of the five centers in India approved for providing a recognized Fellowship program in Developmental Pediatrics, the IAP Fellowship in Developmental Pediatrics. Training (Center for influence): In January 2017, Ummeed set up a dedicated training facility to extend its reach to at-risk and undiagnosed children in the community. They do this through training professionals, parents, teachers, community workers and partner organizations in a range of various disciplines in the child development & disability space.Research:Ummeed participated in a five-year four-country research project funded by the National Institutes of health, USA and in partnership with Yale University and the University of Ankara, to develop and test a tool to monitor and support Early Childhood Development specifically for use in low and middle-income countries. This tool is now used in Ummeed\'s community programs to monitor child development. The findings of this research have recently been published in the Lancet, one of the most prestigious peer reviewed medical journals. Advocacy: *        Ummeed is constantly working to better the lives of children with disabilities. Towards this, Ummeed is a member of the National Trust, the disability committee of the WHO, the Rehabilitation Council of India, Action for Autism, and is also part of the task force for the implementation of the Right to education Act. Ummeed personnel also serve as experts on the committee formed for the implementation of the Rashtriya Bal Swasthiya Karyakram of the Government of India.UMMEED has reached out to over 16 Government special schools, trained 80 teachers in these schools working with over 4000 children through the school outreach programme.',

                  'description': 'Founded in 1993, The Tamilnad Kidney Research Foundation was set up primarily to provide financial assistance to underprivileged patients for dialysis, transplantation, investigation and medication costs. The Foundation also aims to encourage organ donation at the time of death. TANKER was started by Dr. Georgi Abraham along with a group of like-minded individuals. From providing financial assistance to needy patients and spreading awareness to providing subsidized and free dialysis, TANKER has taken every effort to live up to its vision. It currently provides services in the following areas:Dialysis: A person suffering from kidney failure can survive only when he/she undergoes dialysis or a kidney transplantation. Haemodialysis involves the use of an artificial kidney termed "Dialyser", which emulates the functions of a normal kidney. It needs to be done 2-3 times a week and is an expensive process. TANKER Foundation has made dialysis affordable for economically backward sections using their Subsidised Units. Dialysis in a private hospital costs anywhere between Rs 1500 to Rs. 2500. At TANKER, dialysis is offered either free or at a subsidised rate of Rs. 375 to patients. It costs TANKER Rs.1100 for every dialysis. The shortfall of Rs.725 is covered by donations from well wishers. Presently 377 patients benefit from this every month.Fistula- An A V fistula is essential for dialysis. This is created surgically by joining a vein to an artery in the area of the wrist. Impure blood is first drawn from the fistula on the patient\'s wrist, passed through the dialyser machine and clean blood is returned to the patient. A Fistula surgery costs between Rs. 10,000/- to Rs. 15,000/-, which is beyond what many patients can afford. Financial Support- The Foundation helps needy patients from all over India by offering them one-time contributions ranging from Rs.1,500/- to Rs.20,000/- towards transplantation, investigation and post-transplantation medication costs. Research grants- The importance of advances in Kidney research is recognised by TANKER. Funding is provided to research projects for studies in various aspects of kidney disease. Internships and training- TANKER at its various dialysis units provides training and internship for budding nurses, lab technicians and those looking at Administrative roles. The Foundation is also a training ground for students of Social Work, Public Relations and Sociology.Organ Donation- TANKER encourages deceased-donor organ donation that can be a boon for not just kidney patients but also for others suffering from life threatening ailments. Deceased-donor organ donation is not very popular in our country and hence the recipient waiting lists are long.Deceased-donor organ donation consists of removing viable organs from brain dead donors and then transplanting them into a living patient who needs it. Soon after a patient is declared brain dead (the patient is dead but the heart maintains circulation usually with mechanical ventilation support), the organs are harvested. The harvested organs are then kept cold to delay the natural decaying process. These are then transplanted to the needy patient.TANKER under the Deceased-Donor Transplantation Programme, sponsored a meeting of surgeons and physicians in October, 2005. Their recommendation to the health Secretary resulted in the expansion of the panel of specialists who certify brain-stem death. The TANKER Trustee Doctors were part of the team that performed the first government approved multi organ deceased-donor transplant in December 1995. TANKER also supports MOHAN (Multi Organ Harvesting Aid Network) Foundation in creating awareness about deceased-donor organ donation.',

The organization runs a residential tribal Vidyalaya where children from depressing backgrounds with alcoholic parents are sheltered and provided with all needs free-of-cost.  Mr. Baburaj, the Chairman hails from an orthodox family. He leads a simple life and has been serving this tribal community for 20 years. A graduate in commerce, he left his job at Mumbai to dedicate all his time to serve these people. According to him, this service is a dedication to God as these children are God's own.",
